      <div class="news-text"> Benefits of Energy Efficient Design Part 3: Financial Savings ðŸ’²ðŸ’²ðŸ’² Often when talking to people with a slightly negative view of the thermal efficiency requirements in the National Construction Code, a common idea is they feel these requirements make the building process more expensive. We can certainly see why they might feel that way, as some designs do require expensive upgrades to achieve conpliance. However, with larger sample sizes it&#39;s evident that designing for thermal efficiency actually saves money. How? Watch this video to find out! Also, be sure to look out for our next video which will explain an important concept in thermally efficient design!
